Final Degree Project - PLQuiz
======

**Degree in Computer Engineering, University of Burgos**

PLQuiz is an application that allows the generation of questionnaires on the application of the most common algorithms used in lexical analysis to convert a regular expression into a finite automaton that recognizes the language represented by the regular expression.

Quizzes are presented in Moodle-compatible or print-ready format, including high-resolution images using vector graphics.

Exercises can be generated from a given regular expression or automatically, using random and genetic search algorithms.
